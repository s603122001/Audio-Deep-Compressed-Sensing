# Audio-Deep-Compressed-Sensing

Compressed sensing aims at representing sparse signals using random measurements at a sampling rate much lower than the Nyquist rate and so achieve the goal of compression. In this project we utilize SpecGAN to be a probability prior capable of generating spectrograms which have similar distribution to the domain of input audio. With this prior model, we can reconstruct input audio signal from low-dimensional latent vectors.
